    How to play Snake Game

    •	The snake is resembled by a number of fixed size squares, starting from at least three squares. For example, the squares below represents 
        a snake, and the square[0] represents the snake head. 2	1	0
    •	The snake starts at the center of the board, moving toward the east (right).
    •	The snake moves only north, south, west, or east (up, down, left, or right).
    •	The snake moves at a constant speed.
    •	The “food”, represented by a circle or a triangle (or other shapes comes with the turtle library), appears at a random location on the  
        screen.
    •	There is always exactly one “food” visible at any given time.
    •	When the snake "eats" (runs into) the “food”
        -	it grows longer by one square 3  2	1	0
        -	the score on the scoreboard increment by a certain amount of number.
    •	The game continues until the snake either
        -	(1) runs into the boarder of the screen, or
        -	(2) runs into its own tail.
    •	The final score is based on the number of food eaten by the snake.
    •	The snake can be controlled by the arrow keys: up, down, left, and right (you can use additional keysets if you like, but use at least     
        these.)
